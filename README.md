## Reflection on the `handle_connection` Method

The `handle_connection` method is responsible for processing an incoming TCP stream and handling the HTTP request sent by the client. Here's a breakdown of what happens inside this method:

1. **Buffered Reading of the Stream**:
   - A `BufReader` is created to wrap the incoming `TcpStream`. This allows for efficient reading of the stream line by line.

2. **Parsing the HTTP Request**:
   - The method reads lines from the stream using the `lines()` iterator.
   - Each line is unwrapped to handle potential errors during reading.
   - The `take_while` function is used to collect lines until an empty line is encountered, which signifies the end of the HTTP request headers.
   - The collected lines are stored in a `Vec<String>` called `http_request`.

3. **Debugging the Request**:
   - The parsed HTTP request is printed to the console in a formatted manner using `println!` and the `:#?` debug formatter. This is useful for debugging and understanding the structure of the incoming request.

### Key Points
- The method currently only reads and prints the HTTP request but does not process it further (e.g., routing or responding to specific requests).
- It assumes that the incoming data is valid UTF-8 and does not handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., malformed requests or connection issues).
- This implementation is a good starting point for building a basic HTTP server, but it can be extended to include features like request parsing, routing, and response generation.

This method demonstrates the foundational steps of handling HTTP requests in a Rust-based server.
